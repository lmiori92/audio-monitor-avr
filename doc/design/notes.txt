Latch-up (?)
############

From time to time the +12V rail started up with a voltage of about -0.6V.
This has been solved placing an external diode in reverse configuration between
the ground and the output of the +12V and -12V rails regulators.

=> This fixed that.

############
Boot-up
############

The microcontroller randomly fails to boot.
Sometimes, it also displays "no ISR!" which means an interrupt
has fired but no associated ISR is programmed -> weird!
This possibly indicates a fault in reading the flash of the MCU.

Interesting is that I have never seen this problem to occur before
adding the auxiliary analog +12V/-12V rails.

=> Brown-out detector was NOT enabled in the fuse configuration.
   This solves the problem (puts the MCU in reset below 4.0V which
   is well withing the Safe Operation Area of the device)

##############################
Insane noise in the ADC input
##############################

The analog input is composed by an inverting op-amp stage, which is
supplied by +12V and -12V rails.
The +12V was simply connected to the SMPS' +12V rail, since it is
supposed to be well filtered by a linear regulator.
The -12V is derived from the -31V rail for the VFD display by using
a negative -12V regulator; the latter was introduced locally on the
processing board while the former, as antipated, is built into the
SMPS. Well, one has to expect a linear regulator to be fairly stable
and "silent". No, think again!
Unfortunately the SMPS presents to the regulator a voltage that is
barely enough to pass through !!! (~12.19V, well well well below 
the minimum input supply). Clearly, something has failed or the desing
presented a huge flaw that has been apparently left into the design
and tackled by applying local filtering / regulation.

=> Solution: positive +12V linear regulator locally on board, and the
op-amp is silent as it is supposed to be.

ADC Noise
##########################

First tests have reported quite a huge noise fluctuations in the ADC
readout: +/- ~55 -> absolute ~110 max variation over time which is
rather unacceptable considering the S/N ratio of more than 10% over
the entire range!

=> the test input cable was acting as "antenna" capturing all sort of crap.
Moreover, local filtering of Aref and Avcc considerably helps.
To be tested: external Vref (TL431?) and possibly regulation for the Avcc,
derived from +12V filtered rail.
Also, I would consider a review of the ground star and possibly filter out
digital signals going to the VFD display, which seems quite noisy.
